            <p>Albert Einstein was a physicist who developed the general theory of relativity. He is considered one of
                the most influential scientists of the 20th century.</p>

            <h3>Who Was Albert Einstein?</h3>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories
                of
                relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
                In
                the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after being targeted by the German Nazi Party. </p>
            <p>
                His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein
                focused
                on unified field theory. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most
                influential
                physicist of the 20th century.

                <h3>Early Life & Family</h3>
                <br>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany. Einstein grew up in a secular
                    Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother,
                    founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that mass-produced
                    electrical equipment</p><br>
                <p>Einstein’s mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja,
                    born two years after him.</p><br>
                <p>Einstein attended elementary school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he felt alienated
                    there and struggled with the institution's rigid pedagogical style</p><br>
                <p>He also had what were considered speech challenges, though he developed a passion for classical music
                    and playing the violin, which would stay with him into his later years. Most significantly,
                    Einstein's youth was marked by deep inquisitiveness and inquiry.</p><br>
                <p>Towards the end of the 1880s, Max Talmud, a Polish medical student who sometimes dined with the
                    Einstein family, became an informal tutor to young Einstein. Talmud had introduced his pupil to a
                    children’s science text that inspired Einstein to dream about the nature of light.</p><br>
                <p>Thus, during his teens, Einstein penned what would be seen as his first major paper, "The
                    Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields.</p><br>
                <p>Hermann Einstein relocated the family to Milan, Italy, in the mid-1890s after his business lost out
                    on a major contract. Einstein was left at a relative's boarding house in Munich to complete his
                    schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. </p><br>
                <p>Faced with military duty when he turned of age, Einstein allegedly withdrew from classes, using a
                    doctor’s note to excuse himself and claim nervous exhaustion. With their son rejoining them in
                    Italy, his parents understood Einstein's perspective but were concerned about his future prospects
                    as a school dropout and draft dodger.</p><br>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <br>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Einstein was eventually able to gain admission into the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
                    Zurich, specifically due to his superb mathematics and physics scores on the entrance exam. </p>
                <p>He was still required to complete his pre-university education first, and thus attended a high school
                    in Aarau, Switzerland helmed by Jost Winteler. Einstein lived with the schoolmaster's family and
                    fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Einstein later renounced his German citizenship and
                    became a Swiss citizen at the dawn of the new century.</p><br>
                <h3>Nobel Prize for Physics</h3>
                <br>
                <hr><br>
                <p>In 1921, Einstein won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect,
                    since his ideas on relativity were still considered questionable. He wasn't actually given the award
                    until the following year due to a bureaucratic ruling, and during his acceptance speech, he still
                    opted to speak about relativity.</p>
                <p>In the development of his general theory, Einstein had held onto the belief that the universe was a
                    fixed, static entity, aka a "cosmological constant," though his later theories directly contradicted
                    this idea and asserted that the universe could be in a state of flux</p>
