            <h3>Who Was Albert Einstein?</h3>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories
                of
                relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
                In
                the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after being targeted by the German Nazi Party. </p>

                His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein
                focused
                on unified field theory. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most
                influential
                physicist of the 20th century.
